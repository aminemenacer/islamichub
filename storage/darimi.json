Abu Hazim said: God’s mercy is close to the doers of good. Solomon said to him: O Abu Hazim, what servants of God are you? Generosity? He said: People of chivalry and prohibition. Solomon said to him: O Abu Hazim, which deed is best? ?, Abu Hazim said: Performing the obligatory duties while avoiding forbidden things. Suleiman said: Which supplication should I hear?, Abu Hazim said: The supplication of the benefactor for the benefactor, He said: Which charity is better? He said: For the miserable beggar, and the effort of the little one does not contain any harm or harm. He said: Which statement is more just? He said: Speaking the truth to someone you fear or hope in. He said: Which of the believers is more just? He said: A man who acts in obedience to God. And he pointed people to it. He said: Which of the believers is a fool? He said: A man who fell in love with his brother while he was unjust. So he sold his afterlife for someone else’s world. Suleiman said to him: You are correct, so what do you say about what we are in? He said: O Commander of the Faithful, will you spare me? Suleiman said to him. That: No, but some advice you can give me, he said: O Commander of the Faithful, your forefathers conquered people with the sword. And they took this king by force, without consulting the Muslims, and without their consent, until they killed some of them in a massive manner, so they left him. If you had known what they said and what was said to them, then a man from among his companions said to him: What you said was miserable, O Abu Hazim. Abu Hazim said. You lied. Indeed, God made a covenant with the scholars that He would make it clear to the people and that they would not hide it. Solomon said to him: How can we make amends? He said: You call arrogance. You cling to chivalry, and swear by integrity. Suleiman said to him: How can we take him? Abu Hazim said: You take him from Untie it and place it among its people. Suleiman said to him: O Abu Hazim, do you have the right to accompany us so that you can share with us and share with yourself? He said: I seek refuge in God. Solomon said to him: Why is that? He said: I fear that if I entrust a little thing to you, God will make me taste the weakness of life and the weakness of death. Solomon said to him: Raise to us your needs? He said: Will you save me from Hell and admit me to Paradise? Solomon said: Not that. To me. Abu Hazim said: I have no need of you other than that. He said: So pray for me. Abu Hazim said: Oh God, if Suleiman is your guardian, make him easy for the good of the world. Hereafter, and if he is your enemy, then take him by his side to what you love and are satisfied with. Solomon said to him: Never. He said Abu Hazim: I have stated it briefly and in detail if you are one of its people, but if you are not one of its people, then what benefit is it for me to shoot from a bow that has no string? Layman: Advise me. He said: I will advise you and summarize: Praise your Lord and make Him exalted in seeing you where He forbade you, or missing you wherever He commanded you. So when he came out From him, he sent him a hundred dinars, and wrote to him: Spend it, but I have a lot like it. He said: Return it to him and wrote to him: Oh, mother. O believers, I seek refuge with God that your question of me be a joke, or that I respond to you with a humiliation and what is satisfactory to you, how can I be satisfactory to myself? He wrote to him: When Musa bin Imran reached the waters of Midian, he found shepherds watering it, and he found besides them two female slaves feeding, so he asked them, and she said A: # We will not irrigate until the shepherds give up, and our father is an old man. {23} So he watered for them, then he turned to the shade and said, “My Lord! Indeed, when you sent down To me is someone who is good and poor. {24} Surat Al-Qasas, verse 23-24 #And that is because he was hungry, afraid, and had no security. So he asked his Lord and did not ask people, so the shepherds did not understand and obeyed. The two maids were buzzing, and when they returned to their father, they told him the story and what he had said. Then their father, while Shuaib was alive, said: This A hungry man said to one of them: Go and invite him. When she came to him, she honored him and covered her face and said: #My father is calling you to reward you. “You have not watered for us.” Surat Al-Qasas, verse 25. So he was distressed by Moses when she mentioned, “Reward for what you watered for us.” And he found no choice but to follow her. He was among the mountains, hungry and desolate. When he followed her, the wind blew and caused her to clap her clothes around her back, so she described her crotch to him. She became helpless, and he made Moses turn away once, and turn away another time, and when his patience ran out, he called her: O servant of God, be behind me and show me the height with your words. When he entered upon Shuaib, he saw that dinner was ready, and Shuaib said to him: Sit down, young man, and have dinner. Then Musa said to him: I seek refuge in God, so Shuaib said to him: B: Why? Aren't you hungry? He said: Yes, but I fear that this will be a compensation for what I gave them water to drink, and we are a family who do not sell anything of our religion for a full price. He brought gold, and Shuaib said to him: No, young man, but it is my custom and the custom of my fathers to welcome guests and provide food. So Moses sat down and ate. If this one hundred dinars was a compensation for what I had done, then a dead body, blood, and pork meat in case of necessity is more permissible than these.

He placed his mouth between my breasts, and I was a young boy at that time. He said: Welcome, my nephew. Ask whatever you want.\nSo I asked him, while he was blind, and the time for prayer came, so he stood in a blanket, wrapped in it. Whenever he put it on his shoulders, its edge returned to the He was young, and his robe was on his side on the holder, so he prayed, and I said: Tell me about the Hajj of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace. ? He raised his hand and held nine, and said: The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, remained for nine years without performing the Hajj, then he announced to the people the Hajj at the tenth: that the Messenger May God’s prayers and peace be upon him. He was a pilgrim, and many people came to Medina, all of them seeking to follow the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him. And he did the same as his work, so we went out with him until we came to Dhul-Hulayfah, and Asma bint Umays gave birth to Muhammad bin Abi Bakr, may God be pleased with them, a mouse. I asked the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace: What should I do? He said: “Wash yourself, put on a garment, and enter ihram.” So the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, prayed in the mosque, then he rode the horse’s back until it was straight. With him was his camel at Al-Bayda, and I saw as far as my sight could see in front of him, of those riding and walking, and to his right the like of that, and to his left Like that, and after him like that, and the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, was among us, and upon him the Qur’an was revealed and he knew its interpretation, so Is it by monotheism: \"At your command, O God, at your command, at your command you have no partner. Indeed, praise and blessings are yours and dominion, you have no partner.\" So the people made the greeting with which they were greeted, but the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, did not respond to them at all, but the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, responded to him. Even when we come to the House with him. Jabir said: We do not intend anything other than Hajj, we do not know Umrah, even when we come to the House with him, he takes the corner, brakes three times, walks four times, then advances to the place of worship. So Ibrahim prayed, so he recited #And they took the place of Ibrahim as a place of prayer, Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 125 #, so he made the place between him and the House, and it was My father says: I do not know that he mentioned it on the authority of Jabir, on the authority of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace: He used to recite in the two rak’ahs: Say: He is God, One Unbelievers. Then he returned to the corner and touched it, then he went out through the door to al-Safa. When he reached al-Safa, he recited: # Indeed, Al-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the symbols of God. Surat Al-Baqarah, verse 158 #, “I begin with what God has begun.” So he began with Al-Safa and moved on it until he saw the House, so he united. God glorified and glorified Him, and said: “There is no god but God alone, He has no partner, He has Sovereignty, and to Him is praise, He gives life and causes death, and He has power over all things. There is no god but God alone. He fulfilled His promise, supported His servant, and defeated the parties. Alone.\nThen he made supplication in between, saying something like this three times, then he descended to al-Marwah, until when it was set His feet were in the depths of the valley. Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman al-Darimi said: meaning: he braked, until when we ascended he walked, until when we reached al-Marwah, then he stopped. On al-Marwah as he did on al-Safa, until when it was the last circumambulation of al-Marwah, he said: “Indeed, if I had faced As for my situation, I did not bring a sacrificial animal, but I made it an Umrah. So whoever of you does not have a sacrificial animal, let him make it permissible and make it an Umrah.” Then Suraqa stood up. Ibn Malik Ibn Jasham, and he said: O Messenger of God, is this our year or forever? Then the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, interlocked his fingers in the other and said: “Umrah has entered Hajj,” like this twice. “No, but never.” Never, nay, forever and ever.”\nAli came with a body from Yemen for the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace. Then Fatima, may God be pleased with her, was found among those who were permissible, and she wore dyed clothes and applied kohl. Ali denounced that to her, and she said: My father commanded me, so Ali used to say: I went to the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, to ask him about Fatima about what she had done, seeking a fatwa from the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace. He said: “You are right, what did you do when you made Hajj obligatory?” Your Messenger has it. He said: “Then I have the sacrificial animal, so it is not permissible.” \nHe said: The group of sacrificial animals with which Ali came from Yemen, and which the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, brought, was one hundred camels, so all the people disbanded and shortened their prayers. No, the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and whoever had a sacrificial animal with him. When it was the Day of Tarwiyah, he headed to Mina, so we celebrated the Hajj, and a messenger rode God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, prayed at Mina the noon, afternoon, sunset, evening, and morning prayers, then he stayed for a little while until when the sun rose, he ordered that A bundle of hair was made for him with a pin, then the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, rode and walked. The Quraysh had no doubt except that he was standing at Al-Mash’ar. forbidden, as the Quraysh used to do in the pre-Islamic era in Muzdalifah. So the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, walked until he came to Arafat, and found the dome. It was struck by a star, so he set it down until it rose, meaning the sun. He ordered the retaliation to be done, and it was set aside for him. So he came to the bottom of the valley, and he addressed the people and said: “ Your blood and your wealth are as sacred as the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this country of yours. However, everything is a matter of the pre-Islamic era. My feet are laid out, and the blood of pre-Islamic times is laid out, and the first blood I will shed is our blood: the blood of Ibn Rabi’ah bin Al-Harith, who was breast-feeding among the Banu Sa’d, so she was killed. This is a tail. The usury of pre-Islamic times is subject to a waiver, and the first usury that I will waive is the usury of Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib, for all of it is subject to a waiver, so fear God regarding women, for it is only You took them with the trust of God, and you made their private parts lawful with the word of God, and you have a duty over them not to put on your bed anyone whom you hate.

Asr, he did not connect at all between them, then he rode until he stopped, so he made the belly of his camel to ride to Sakhirat, and Ismail said: to the bushes, and made a rope He walked in front of him, then he faced the Qiblah and remained standing until the sun set and the yellowish color disappeared, until the disc disappeared, so Osama continued. Behind him, then he pushed, and he had hung the reins on Al-Qasa’a, so much so that her head would hit the edge of his saddle, and he said with his right hand: “Silence, serenity.” \". “Ahmad ibn Yunus narrated to us, Dawud al-Attar narrated to us, on the authority of Ibn Khathim, on the authority of Yusuf ibn Mahak, on the authority of Hafsa bint Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi B Kar al-Siddiq, on the authority of her father, that the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said to Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr: “Sex your sister,” meaning : Aisha and her Umrah from Tan’im, so when she descends from the hill, order her to enter ihram, for it is an upcoming Umrah \"",
