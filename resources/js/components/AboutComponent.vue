     <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold">How it all Began</h2>
     <p class="lead">It all started with a personal realization: the beauty and wisdom of Islam often remain hidden from those who don’t speak Arabic. As someone who has witnessed the transformative power of understanding our faith, I couldn’t stand idly by.</p>
     <p class="lead">I felt a strong calling to create a space where everyone—whether you're a curious soul exploring Islam or a new Muslim finding your way—could access the Quran and its teachings in a language that resonates with them.</p>

     <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold">Why I Built This Platform</h2>

     <p class="lead">I want you to feel empowered to explore Islam without fear or confusion. You deserve clarity and support on your journey, and that’s what we’re here for.</p>
