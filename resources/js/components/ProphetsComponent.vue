              4- <b>Call to Monotheism:</b> Nuh preached the message of monotheism (Tawhid), urging his people to abandon their polytheistic beliefs and return to worshipping only Allah.

              2- <b>Challenges from his Community:</b> Ibrahim faced opposition, rejection, and persecution from his own people, who remained steadfast in their idolatry despite his efforts to guide them to monotheism.

            <p>
              3- <b>The Fiery Trial:</b> One of the notable incidents in Ibrahim's life is the story of him being thrown into a massive fire by his people, known as the "Fiery Trial."

            <h5 class="pb-3 text-center"><b>Key Aspects of Prophet Jesus's Story:</b></h5>

            <h3 class="pb-3 text-center"><b>Prophet Muhammad</b></h3>
            <p>The Five Pillars of Islam represent the core acts of worship and practices that are fundamental to a Muslim's faith and life. They serve as the framework for a Muslim's relationship with God and their community:</p>
            <p>
              1- <b>Shahada (Declaration of Faith):</b> It is the foundational creed of Islam, declaring belief in the oneness of God (Allah) and the acceptance of Prophet Muhammad as His messenger. The declaration is: "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah."
            </p>
            <p>
              2- <b>Salah (Prayer):</b> Muslims perform five obligatory prayers a day facing the Kaaba in Mecca. These prayers are performed at specific times: Fajr (dawn), Dhuhr (noon), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (evening), and Isha (night). Prayer involves recitations from the Quran and specific body movements.
            </p>
            <p>
              3- <b>Zakat (Almsgiving):</b> Zakat is an obligation for Muslims who possess wealth above a certain threshold. It involves giving a portion of one's wealth (usually 2.5%) to help the needy and less fortunate in the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              4- <b>Sawm (Fasting during Ramadan):</b> Muslims fast from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramadan, abstaining from food, drink, smoking, and intimate relations. Fasting is an act of self-discipline, spiritual reflection, and empathy for the less fortunate.
            </p>
            <p>
              5- <b>Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca):</b> It is a pilgrimage that every able-bodied and financially capable Muslim is obligated to undertake at least once in their lifetime, if circumstances allow. It occurs during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah and involves a series of rituals performed at specific locations in and around Mecca.
            </p>
            <p>These pillars serve as a guide for a Muslim's daily life, fostering a strong connection with God, promoting charity, discipline, community engagement, and spiritual growth. They also reinforce the unity of Muslims worldwide through shared acts of worship and devotion.</p>
